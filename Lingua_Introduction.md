# Lingua: Bridging Developers and Language Models

## Introduction
Lingua is a unique interface designed to enhance the interaction between developers and large language models. With a syntax that marries programming logic with natural language processing, Lingua aims to streamline tasks like querying, debugging, data management, and more.

## Vision
While Lingua starts as an interface, our long-term vision is to evolve it into a full-fledged, general-purpose programming language that seamlessly integrates advanced AI models.
